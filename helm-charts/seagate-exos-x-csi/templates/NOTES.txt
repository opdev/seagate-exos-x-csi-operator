Thank you for using Seagate Exos X provisioner. It will be up and running shortly.
Run 'kubectl get pods' to verify that the new pods have a 'STATUS' of 'Running'.

In order to dynamically provide a persistant volume, create a storage class first.
Please refer to this example to do so: https://github.com/Seagate/seagate-exos-x-csi/blob/main/example/storage-class.yaml
